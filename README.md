# General info

Last months we realized that Zoom (https://zoom.us) is the best meeting and conferencing service for us. Besides, we have to do mass users, meetings and webinars management. Hundreds of users, thousands of meetings processing... 

So, we need Zoom API. And we need lots of API requests. And PHP engine is most optimal for our tasks. 

This wrapper is a library we use in our work. 
No best practices used! It just works now!
But you're welcome to fix that! 

Let's do the best Zoom API PHP Wrapper together!


# Application

Now it is a sample OAuth 2.0 application with the core in `Classes/ZoomAPI.php` - that's the main thing! 

Requests are built with `Classes/ZoomHttpRequest.php`. See usage examples (`page/*.php` and `/index.php`).
